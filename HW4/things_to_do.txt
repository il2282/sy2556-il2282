THINGS TO DO

1. time series data is in the data folder.

2. input of mainrpower: .exe_file time_series_data_parameters_filename file number_of_workers number_of_jobs

3. perturbation is done in mainrpower.c. worker only takes time series data.

--------------------------------------------------------

PROGRESS

Joseph:
mainrpower.c is pretty much done. bag now contains purtubed time series, mean, covariance matrix, etc. Now I need to work on:
	- finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
	- run optimization problems.
Probably create a worker.c file that contains functions that do the above 2 steps.
